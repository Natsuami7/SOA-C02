# EC2

---

## ‚ú® EC2 Essentials for the Exam

- EC2 = virtual machines (instances) launched from AMIs (Amazon Machine Images)
- Designed for elasticity: scale up/down based on demand
- Choose specific Regions and AZs for high availability and redundancy

---

## üîç Instance Types & Lifecycle

- **Instance Families**:
    - General Purpose (T, M), Compute Optimized (C), Memory (R), Storage (I)
- **Lifecycle Actions**:
    - Launch ‚Üí Stop ‚Üí Start ‚Üí Terminate
- **Stop**: Keeps EBS data, loses instance store
- **Terminate**: Deletes instance and storage unless EBS "Delete on Termination" is disabled

---

## üì• Storage Options

- **EBS (Elastic Block Store)**:
    - Persistent storage
    - Snapshots supported
    - Can be encrypted (KMS integration)
- **Instance Store**:
    - Ephemeral storage tied to the instance
    - Lost when stopped or terminated

---

## üåê Networking & IPs

- **Elastic IP**: Static IPv4 address retained across instance stops/starts
- **Security Groups**: Stateful, instance-level firewall
- **NACLs**: Stateless, subnet-level firewall
- **Private IP/Public IP** managed via VPC

---

## üîê Security & Access

- Use **Key Pairs** for SSH access
- Attach **IAM Roles** to EC2 for secure permissions (no hardcoding credentials)
- Enable **EBS Encryption** using **KMS (Key Management Service)**

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Monitoring & Maintenance

- **CloudWatch**: Monitor CPU, network, disk, memory (custom metrics)
- **CloudTrail**: Logs API activity for auditing
- **EBS Snapshots**: Backup strategy, automate with Lifecycle Manager
- **Auto Scaling**: Adjust instance count using metrics or schedules

---

## ‚ö° High Availability & Resilience

- **Placement Groups**:
    - Cluster (low latency, same hardware)
    - Spread (instances across racks for fault tolerance)
- Use with multi-AZ, Load Balancers, and Auto Scaling

---

## ‚ùå Skip/Skim (Low Exam Value)

- EC2 pricing models in depth (On-Demand vs Reserved vs Spot)
- Marketplace details
- Cost calculators and TCO comparisons

---

## ü§ì Exam Tips

- IAM Role + EC2 = secure permissions without keys
- Always choose **EBS** for persistent data needs
- Know difference between **SG** and **NACL**
- Understand **snapshot encryption** and cross-region use cases
- Be confident with monitoring and auto-recovery setups

---

## üìö Suggested Practice

- Launch EC2, attach IAM role, enable CloudWatch
- Create/restore snapshots
- Trigger auto-scaling from CloudWatch alarm
- Block ports using Security Group rules
